LBi Denmark asked me to stop by their internal event called "We do our own stunts", to talk a bit about Podio.

In the context of doing stunts I thought the evolution of the Podio front-end stack would be a great fit. At Podio we have been through a big technical transition. We switched out our complete frontend stack from PHP to Ruby, while we continued to itirate and release new features in our product.

This was a bold decision and a atypical project, you rarely see in a startup. We didn't have 6 months to set aside for refactoring. Instead choose to tacle this from a different perspective: We chose to look at this as a perfect opportunity to review all the features in the product. With this opportunity in our hands, the flow as actually straight forward. Everytime we added or improved a feature, we would implemented it in our new code-base, and make the transition completely transparant for our users.

Our goals with this project was to ensure a solid techinical platform that would enable us to keep our team productive, while growing. Be on the technical fore-front and have a great foundation to deliver the best experience to our users.

This was our "air-bourne stunt". One hell of a trans-atlantic flight.
