Three weeks ago I attended [Chrome Dev Summit 15](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit) down at Google offices in Mountain View, and what an experience! It’s the third year Google is running Chrome Dev Summit, and this year you could really feel that the event is a new priority for Google.

Chrome DevSummit is rather small with roughtly 300 participants, mainly from browser vendors, web standards folks, influencers and of-course Googlers. This mix of people creates an unique atmosphere, much similar to [EdgeConf](https://edgeconf.com/), as everyone attending, are deeply involved with the web. This made the networking, dicussions and hall-way track at this years event simply fantastic.

## Google's vision for the Web

The first day was kicked-of with a [keynote by Darin Fisher, VP of Chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICcHeQY02XLvoGL34rZFWZn&v=m2a9hlUFRhg), where he gave a “State of Chrome”-talk. He provided a bunch of key milestones, numbers and acheivements by Chrome, which was great to see shared by a browser vendor. It's clear that Chrome contiues to gather momentum, with more than 800 million users on mobile, in addition to it's massive desktop base.

### The web is a priority and a 1st class platform to build apps for Google

The main take away from this years Chrome Dev Summit was that Google sees the web platform as a "1st class platform" in the overall app ecosystem. For some this might not be news, but in an Android dominiated world, I think this is an extremely powerfull statement, that shows Google is still committed to be building the web, as an open platform, where competition and standards play an important role.

This gives me hope, that we'll continue to see Google investing into Chrome and the webplatform as alternative app platform to it's proprietary Android platform. Our current mobile platforms really needs an open alternative, and the web can be that!

The emphasis of the web being ready as a fully fledged application, was implied in in most of the event's sessions, that each showed how new primitives like [Service Worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/), [Push Notifications]( https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web?hl=en) and [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/), can be put together in into an extremely compelling app model, which [Alex Russel](https://twitter.com/slightlylate) a few months back, coined as [Progressive Web Apps](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/), that work's across browser, devices, platforms and most importantly, vendors.

Google wants developers to build for the web, regardless of the targeted browser, platform and device, and that's huge!

## A flashback to the good days of Google I/O

This year's Chrome Dev Summit reminded me of the good days at Google I/O, where I attended to get an overview on how Chrome is doing and how Google sees the future for the web. I've been missing this. Google I/O has in the recently years changed it's focus, to be much broader, with a focus on Android and Google products in general.

The change of Google I/O is a natural consequence of Android growing and Google focusing on a broader variety of products, but this broader focus has also meant that going to Google I/O as a front-end/web developer, isn't very attractive anymore. I/O has simply lost it's value, as the number of sessions related to web simply have declined to almost zero.

Aan web-focused event from Google has been much needed, as they continuous to be driving many important initiatives on the web, and with Chrome Dev Summit they have filled that gap.

### Wish all browser vendors did the same

Chrome Dev Summit was great, but the web is more than once vendor, and is built by multiple browsers, implementations and opinions coming together. It's important for us building to the web, to have each vendor sharing it's vision for the web, but so far we mostly heard about Google's.

Going forward I hope this will change, and we'll see all major browser vendors doing events similar to Chrome Dev Summit. Microsoft has already stepped up by doing it's first [Edge Dev Summit](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/04/13/2015-microsoft-edge-web-summit/) last year, so let's see what the future brings.

Maybe someday we can have all browsers vendors present at same event?

That would be wonderful.

And Google, why didn't you just call it "Chrome Summit"? Much easier to say, remember and a shorter hashtag :)
