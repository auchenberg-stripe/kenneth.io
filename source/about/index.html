  <p>I'm Kenneth. I have specialized in the browser, because I believe the web platform is the future for our applications.</p>

  <p>I often speak in public; in communities, at conferences and in companies. Mostly I talk about front-end development, and the web platform, but you'll also hear me talk about things like architecture, minimalism and design, simply because I'm curious about how we, human beings, interpret and interact with the world.</p>

  <p>I'm here to make the web a better place - especially for us developers.</p>

  <p>Don't hesitate to contact me at <a href="mailto:kenneth@auchenberg.dk">kenneth@auchenberg.dk</a> or via <a href="http://twitter.com/auchenberg">@auchenberg</a>. I'm always ready to chat, especially if you have an interesting project for me.</p>
