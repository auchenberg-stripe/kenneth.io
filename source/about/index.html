<section>

  <p>I'm Kenneth. I believe the web is the future for applications, which is why I have specialized in the browser.</p>

  <p>I often speak in public; in communities, at conferences and in companies. Mostly I talk about front-end development, and the web platform, but you'll also hear me talk about things like architecture, minimalism and design, because I'm curious about how we, human beings, interpret and interact with the world.</p>

  <p>I'm here to make the web a better place - especially for us developers.</p>
